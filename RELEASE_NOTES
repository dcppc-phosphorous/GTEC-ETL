v0.7 Release Notes

This is the v0.7 release of the KC7 crosscut metadata model instance for the following datasets:

   -GTEx v7 public RNA-Seq and WGS metadata from the GTEx Portal and dbGaP study phs000424.v7.p2
   -TOPMed public metadata for dbGaP studies phs001024.v3.p1, phs000951.v2.p2, and phs000179.v5.p2
   -Alliance/AGR gene location and ortholog and phenotype data for mouse and rat reference genomes

The Python scripts used to generate this release may also be run on dbGAP controlled access metadata 
for the three TOPMed studies (phs001024.v3.p1, phs000951.v2.p2, and phs000179.v5.p2) and one 
GTEx study (phs000424.v7.p2), in which case they will produce DATS JSON-LD for the actual (meta)data.
Any file produced in this way will contain controlled access sample and subject phenotype information, 
and therefore cannot be freely distributed.

For more information on the crosscut metadata model and the DATS JSON-LD encoding please see the 
README.md at https://github.com/dcppc/crosscut-metadata
